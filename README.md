# Autonomous Research Agent 🔍

An AI agent that demonstrates core Agentic AI principles by autonomously researching topics and generating detailed reports.

## 🚀 Features

- **Tool Use:** Integrates with the Tavily Search API to perform real-time web research.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Orchestrates a sequential workflow (Research -> Synthesis -> Report Generation).
- **Professional Output:** Generates well-structured, comprehensive reports in Markdown format.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Google Gemini API** (`gemini-1.5-flash`)
- **Tavily Search API**
- **Google Colab** (for execution)

## 🏗️ Architecture

1.  **Input:** User provides a research topic.
2.  **Research Phase:** The agent uses the Tavily API to find recent, relevant information.
3.  **Synthesis Phase:** The agent uses a Gemini model to analyze, structure, and write a professional report based on the research.
4.  **Output:** A detailed Markdown report is generated and saved to a file.
